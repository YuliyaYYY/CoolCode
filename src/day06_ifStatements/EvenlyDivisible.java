/*
Create a class named EvenlyDivisible, and write a program that can check if a number is evenly divisible by 2, 3, 5
            Ex:
                number = 65;

            output:
                65 is divisible by 2: false
                65 is divisible by 3: false
                65 is divisible by 5: true

            Evenly Divisible ==> remainder is zero
